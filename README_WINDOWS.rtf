==================

To get a first look at relish programming, read the "Simple Program Trial Environment" Quick-Start Guide, in the Tutorials tab of the http://relish.pl website.
NOTE that the relish windows .msi installer will start up the Simple Program Trial Environment (also known as relish playground) at the end of the installation process. 

To learn how to program in relish, read the "relish Syntax and Semantics By Example - From the Inside Out" reference manual in the References tab of the http://relish.pl website.

To edit relish programs, you should probably use the "Sublime Text" editor, because it's a pretty decent code editing tool, and because there is a relish syntax colouring extension package for Sublime Text. Instructions for adding relish syntax colouring to Sublime Text can be found in the tools\README_WINDOWS.txt file in your relish installation directory tree.
