<meta name="keywords" content="relish programming language web application development framework persistence" />
 <meta name="description" content="Home page for relish(TM), an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy." />

		<dt><a href="relish_roadmap.html">relish Roadmap</a></dt> 
		<dd>A list of relish programming language features planned but not yet implemented in the current version of the language. The list is aspirational. The order of listing in the roadmap is only an approximate indication of the order in which the features may come to fruition in the language.</dd>		

    <dt><a href="known_limitations.html">Known Limitations</a></dt> 
    <dd>relish is definitely usable, but is at a formative stage of development. It has known limitations, as listed here.
    See also <a href="https://code.google.com/p/relish/issues/list" target="_blank">https://code.google.com/p/relish/issues/list</a><br/>
    relish, being as it is at version 0.1.2 or so, is also subject to change.<br/>No doubt relish also currently features Rumsfeldian unknown unknowns. If you find a problem or have a suggestion for improvement of the relish language, libraries, or programming environment/tools, please report it at the code.google.com link above.<br/>You might still find relish, as is, worthwhile. It is being used in several active web-app projects, including a couple of web-apps in production.</dd>
