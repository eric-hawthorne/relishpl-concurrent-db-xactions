<meta name="keywords" content="relish programming language web application development framework persistence" />
 <meta name="description" content="Home page for relish(TM), an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy." />

	<h3>Origin Registration in progress</h3>
	<p>
		An email message has been sent to {{.email}}. The message contains a link that you must click on to confirm the registration of the relish code origin <b>{{.originId}}</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you click on that confirmation link, you will be asked to enter the password you just created once again. When you do that you will receive a private key and public key in the form of base-64-encoded text blocks (in PEM format).
		These encryption keys must be installed in the keys/private and keys/public directories of your relish installation, so that
		you can use the keys to publish signed (verified as from your origin) relish code artifacts.
	</p>
	<p>
		More details on how to install the private and public key in your relish installation will be given on the page that gives you the keys.
	</p>
	<p>
	DO NOT OPEN THE EMAIL MESSAGE UNLESS YOU ARE ON THE COMPUTER THAT HAS YOUR RELISH INSTALLATION !!
