<meta name="keywords" content="relish programming language web application development framework persistence" />
 <meta name="description" content="Home page for relish(TM), an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy." />

	<h3>Binary Distributions</h3>
	<p>
		Click one of the links below to download a relish binary distribution for your computing platform. <br/>
    See "further installation notes" below for how to determine whether you have 64-bit or 32-bit linux.<br/>
    Note that the linux binary distributions require separate installation of sqlite3 (version 3.5 or greater) if sqlite3 is not already present on the computer. Apple computers already have sqlite3 installed.

	</p>
	<p>You can install relish under your home directory, or, perhaps better, especially for production servers, you can install it in /opt/relish .
   </p>
   <p>Home directory installation:<br/><pre>
   mkdir ~/relish
   cd ~/Downloads   # or wherever your binary tarball file was downloaded to.
   mv relish_&lt;version&gt;.&lt;platform&gt;.tar.gz ~/relish   # on MACOSX, the .gz has already been stripped
   cd ~/relish
   tar zxf relish_&lt;version&gt;.&lt;platform&gt;.tar.gz    # on MACOSX, tar xf relish_&lt;version&gt;.&lt;platform&gt;.tar
   sudo ./install.sh    # creates symbolic links in /usr/local/bin to ~/relish/bin/ executables 
                        # (puts relish command in your PATH)
   relish shared.relish.pl2012/hello_application
   </pre>
   </p>	
	<p>opt directory installation:<br/><pre>
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/relish
   sudo chmod go+wx /opt/relish   
   cd ~/Downloads    # or wherever your binary tarball file was downloaded to.
   mv relish_&lt;version&gt;.&lt;platform&gt;.tar.gz /opt/relish   # on MACOSX, the .gz has already been stripped
   cd /opt/relish
   tar zxf relish_&lt;version&gt;.&lt;platform&gt;.tar.gz    # on MACOSX, tar xf relish_&lt;version&gt;.&lt;platform&gt;.tar
   sudo ./install.sh    # creates symbolic links in /usr/local/bin to /opt/relish/bin/ executables 
                        # (puts relish command in your PATH)

	<h3>Source Code Distribution</h3>
	<p>
		The relish software project is hosted at
	 <a href="http://code.google.com/p/relish/">https://code.google.com/p/relish/</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		To compile the relish programming language, you will first have to install the Go programming language version 1.1 or 1.2  (http://golang.org).<br/>
		If on linux, you also need sqlite3 (3.5+) and libsqlite3-dev  (sqlite3 C header files) installed.<br/>
		On MACOSX, sqlite3 is already installed but you need the libsqlite3-dev library, which should be obtainable 
		by downloading and installing Apple's full <b>Xcode</b> toolkit, or by downloading and installing
		the <b>Command Line Developer Tools</b> subset of Xcode, which is currently described and available at 
		developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/features. Note you need an AppleID to download these.
	</p>	
	<pre>	
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/devel
   sudo chmod go+wx /opt/devel
   cd /opt/devel
   hg clone https://code.google.com/p/relish/ 
   export GOPATH=/opt/devel/relish              # You should add this export statement to your ~/.bashrc file 
                                                # in linux, or create a ~/.bash_profile file in MACOSX and edit
                                                # it to contain the export statement
                                                
   # Make sure sqlite3 and libsqlite3-dev are installed before next step.                                             
   go get code.google.com/p/gosqlite/sqlite  
   cd relish
   go install relish/relish
   sudo ./install.sh    # creates symbolic links in /usr/local/bin to /opt/devel/relish/bin/ executables
