<meta name="keywords" content="relish programming language web application development framework persistence" />
 <meta name="description" content="Home page for relish(TM), an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy." />

	<h3>Source Code Distribution</h3>
	<p>
		The relish software project is hosted at
	 <a href="http://code.google.com/p/relish/">http://code.google.com/p/relish/</a>
	</p>	
	<p>
		To compile the relish programming language, you will first have to install the Go programming language (http://golang.org), the gosqlite package,  sqlite3 (3.5+) and libsqlite3-dev  (sqlite3 C header files). 
	</p>
	<p>
		Installation and build instructions can be found in README_INSTALL.txt in the root directory of the source distribution.
	</p>
	<h3>Binary Distributions</h3>
	<p>
		It should shortly be possible to download a relish binary distribution. Initially, these binary distributions will still require separate installation of sqlite3 (version 3.5 or greater) if sqlite3 is not already present on the platform, but will not require the installation of the Go programming language.
	</p>
	<p>
		Binary distributions are planned in the relatively near term for 
		linux i386, linux amd64, and macosx.
