datetime - the relish programming language
</title>

<meta name="keywords" content="relish programming language web application development framework persistence" />
 <meta name="description" content="Home page for relish(TM), an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy." />

<p>
	Provides functionality for measuring and displaying time. These methods operate on relish's built-in Time data-type (which is a primitive value type like Int, rather than a by-reference object type.)
</p>
<p>
	The calendrical calculations always assume a Gregorian calendar.	
</p>
<p>
    Based on the data types and methods in the Go time package. The Time data-type represents a moment in time as well as a reference to a location on Earth. The location determines how the time will be displayed. Converting a Time to have a different location does not change the moment in time, just how it will be displayed when formatted as a String. It will be formatted as a local time in the location, accounting for time zones, daylight-savings rules, etc. The special location "UTC" will display a time in universal coordinated time (Greenwich Mean Time). See <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/time/" target="_blank">Go time package documentation</a> for further details.
</p>
<p>
The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000 UTC. As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, this  gives a simple way<br/> 
<code><pre>   if not t
      ...</pre></code>
of detecting a time that has not been initialized explicitly. 
</p>
<p>
    <em>Important Note: In relish, if a Time is persisted in the local database (as an attribute of some persisted object), the precision of the Time will be reduced to a whole number of milliseconds. Further precision in the former in-memory Time moment will be lost upon restoration of the Time into memory from the database. A time such as 1983-09-25 21:13:45.875983291Z will 
	become 1983-09-25 21:13:45.876Z. So precise nanosecond time moments and calculations can be used in programming with relish Time, in methods that manipulate non-persistent Time values, but the nanoseconds-precision will be lost if the Time is persisted as an attribute of some object.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Note: This relish time package uses the 64-bit Int data-type to represent durations, rather than a dedicated Duration type as Go uses. Ints are also used for Month numbers and Weekdays, unlike Go's dedicated types.</em>
