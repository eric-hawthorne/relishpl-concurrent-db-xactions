files - the relish programming language
</title>

<meta name="keywords" content="relish programming language web application development framework persistence" />
 <meta name="description" content="File i/o library for relish(TM), an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy." />

<p>
	File I/O. relish Files and their operations are a wrapping of Go's os.File type. <br/>
  See also relish's <b>io</b> package, which provides abstract types and methods for I/O.
  The files.File type in relish subclasses the io.Reader, io.Writer, and io.Closer types.<br/>
  See <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/io/" target="_blank">Go io package documentation</a> and <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/os/" target="_blank">Go os package documentaton</a> (File and FileInfo types and methods section) for further details.
</p>
<p>
  IMPORTANT NOTE: relish file methods which accept filesystem-path arguments accept only unix-style
  path syntax, with "/" as directory separator. "\" or "\\" separated paths are not accepted.
  These paths will be translated automatically to Windows-style paths if relish is running on MS-Windows,
  using Go's filepath.FromSlash(path string) method.
  </p>
  <p>
  Similarly the tempDir method returns a "/" separated path, regardless of operating system relish is running on.
</p>
<p>
  The Windows path C:\foo\bar.txt should be expressed "C:/foo/bar.txt".\br/>
  The Windows UNC path \\myserver\share\foo\bar.txt should be expressed "//myserver/share/foo/bar.txt"

<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>
<code><pre>
<a name="file">File</a> &lt;: io.Reader io.Writer io.Closer
"""
 A File represents an open file descriptor.
 A file, described at the logical level, is a named, readable and/or writable/appendable sequence of bytes 
 stored in persistent storage on the computer.

 Constructor call:

 file err = File filePath [mode [perm]]

 mode = "r" - read only (the default)
        "w" - write only, creates if not exist, or truncates if does
        "a" - appends, creates if not exist
        "r+" - read and write, creates if not exist, does not truncate
        "w+" - read and write, creates if not exist, truncates if does
        "a+" - read and append, creates if not exist, read pointer at end
        "nw" - write only, creates. File must not exist
        "nw+" - read write, creates, File must not exist

 perm = "rwxrwxrwx"
        "rw-rw----"
        "777"
        "660"
        "666" (the default)
"""


<a name="fileinfo">FileInfo</a>
"""
 A FileInfo describes a File and is returned by stat and lstat methods.
"""
   name String  // base name of the file
   size Int  // length in bytes for regular files; system-dependent for others
   mode Uint32  // file mode bits - see Go os package documentation of FileMode type.
   modTime Time  // modification time.
   isDir Bool  // true if the file is a directory
</pre></code>
</p>  

<br/>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<code><pre>

<a name="read">read f File buf Bytes > n Int err String</a>
"""
 Reads up to (len buf) bytes from the file into buf. Returns number of bytes read.
 See io package documentation for detailed comment on the read method behaviour.
"""


<a name="write">write f File val Any > n Int err String</a>
"""
 If val is a Bytes buffer, writes (len buf) bytes from buf to the file.
 If val is a String, writes the String to the file.
 If val is any other value or object type, uses the type's default conversion
 to String to create a String and writes that to the file. 
 It returns the number of bytes written (0 &lt;= n &lt;= len buf if a Bytes buffer) 
 and any error encountered that caused the write to stop early. 
 write must return a non-empty error if it returns n &lt; len buf, or fails to
 write the complete value or object to the file.
"""
 

<a name="close">close f File > err String</a>
"""
 Closes the file, releasing operating system resources that were associated 
 with the open file (such as record locks, file descriptor.)
"""


<a name="readalltext">readAllText 
   f File 
   addMissingLinefeed Bool = false
> 
   fileContent String err String</a>
"""
 Reads all text lines in the file, concatenating them into a single string in which each line
 is terminated by a "\n". 
 If the last line of the file had no line-ending character(s) at its end, the behaviour depends
 on the "addMissingLinefeed" argument. If false (the default) , the last line in the result string
 also has no linefeed "\n" at its end.
 If addMissingLinefeed is true, the last line in the result string gets 
 a "\n" appended, so that lines can be processed in a uniform manner.

 Note that if the file has MSWindows-style line end markers (CRLF i.e. "\r\n") these are replaced
 in the output string by a single "\n" at end of each line.

 An empty file causes the fileContent result to be the empty string.
"""


<a name="readallbinary">readAllBinary f File > fileContent String err String</a>
"""
 Reads the entire file contents into the fileContent String.
 All bytes in the file are put in the String as-is, with no line-end processing.
 You can use this method on text files too, if you like, but you won't get any
 normalizing of line-ending characters. You get the exact file bytes as returned by
 low-level file read functions.
"""


<a name="sync">sync f File > err String</a>
"""
 Commits the current contents of the file to stable storage.
 Typically, this means flushing the file system's in-memory copy
 of recently written data to disk.
"""


<a name="remove">remove path String > err String</a>
"""
 Removes the named file or directory.
"""


<a name="removeall">removeAll path String > err String</a>  
"""
 Removes the named file or directory and all sub directories and contained files recursively.
"""
 

<a name="rename">rename oldName String newName String > err String</a>
"""
 Renames the file or directory.
 Can change the name and/or relocate the file/dir into another existing directory.
"""


<a name="stat">stat path String > fi FileInfo fileExists Bool err String</a>
"""
 stat returns a FileInfo describing the named file. 
 Or if the file/directory/link does not exist, the fileExists return value will be false
 Or if there is any other failure in the attempt to stat, a non-empty err is
 returned as the third argument. 
 Usage:

  path = "myfile.txt"
  fileInfo fileExists err = stat path
  if err
     print "Can't stat file" path ":" err
  elif fileExists
     print path "last modified at" fileInfo.modTime
  else  
     print path "does not exist."
"""   


<a name="lstat">lstat path String > fi FileInfo fileExists Bool err String</a>
"""
 Like stat but does not follow symbolic links. Returns info about the link itself 
 if the name refers to a symbolic link.
"""
