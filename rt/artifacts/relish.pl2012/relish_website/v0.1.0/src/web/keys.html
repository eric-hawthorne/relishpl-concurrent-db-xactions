relish programming language

<meta name="keywords" content="relish programming language web application development framework persistence" />
 <meta name="description" content="Home page for relish(TM), an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy." />

		You must copy them into your own files now. They will not be accessible here again.
		</p>
	<h3>Private Key</h3>
	<p>
		Copy the following key text block and paste it into a text file 
		you create.
		The file should be called /keys/private/origin_{{originId}}_private_key.pem
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>IMPORTANT: It is essential that you keep this private key secret. Anyone who obtains it can publish relish code and claim that it comes from the origin {{originId}}.</em>

{{privateKey}}	
</pre>	
	<h3>Public Key Certificate</h3>
	<p>
		Copy the following key text block and paste it into a text file 
		you create.
		The file should be called /keys/public/origin_{{originId}}_public_key.pem
	</p>
<pre>
{{publicKey}}	
</pre>	
	<p>
		IMPORTANT: If you want to share relish software artifacts internally among different relish installations, or to openly publish relish software artifacts on the Internet, you should now obtain a code-signing encryption-key pair. You will get a private key and a public key. The public key will be certified that it belongs to your code origin, so that code that you publish can be verified using that public key to prove that it came from you and has not been altered.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will receive the encryption keys in the form of base-64-encoded text blocks (in PEM format).
	</p>
<p>
		Press the button below when you are ready to copy the base-64-encoded key text into
		the appropriate files in your relish installation directory tree.
	</p>
	<p>
		Copy the private-key base-64-encoded text block into the file
		relish/keys/private/{{originId}}_private_key.pem
	</p>
	<p>
		Copy the public-key base-64-encoded text block into the file
		relish/keys/public/{{originId}}_public_key.pem

	If you are viewing this page on a smartphone and cannot update your relish installation directories currently, then you should log in to shared.relish.pl again once you get to a computer from which you can add files into your relish installation. When you log in again, you will be given the option to generate your code-signing keys.
