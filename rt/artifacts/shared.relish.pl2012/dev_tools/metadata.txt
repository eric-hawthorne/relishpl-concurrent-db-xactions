Web application which serves as a suite of software development tools to support 
relish programming.

Tools:

Simple Program Trial Environment (also known as the playground)
--------------------------------
This interactive environment allows simple relish programs to be typed in quickly and run. 
This is suitable for learning relish programming, for testing/experimenting relish program 
syntax rules, or for testing/learning the functioning of basic program constructs
or library methods.

The Data Explorer
-------------------
This web app is for exploring and debugging the data objects (and networks of inter-related data objects) 
within a running relish program.
The data explorer can be invoked from the simple program trial environment, to look at
data within the program under trial, or it can be invoked independently and pointed at
an existing large complex relish software application to examine its data while it runs.
The data explorer can be focussed on a particular object within the runtime memory or database of
a running relish program.
It displays that object and its attributes, including other objects which 
are attributes / relations of the focus object. It displays a portion of the object reference tree
(object network) out from the focus object.
The explorer can be refocussed on any of the displayed objects by clicking on the object.
Queries can be performed in the explorer's user interface 
to select objects for potential focus of the explorer.
This explorer runs as one program (process), and the relish program being debugged is another program, 
which must be invoked with the relish -explore <port> option to allow the explorer to query its data.
