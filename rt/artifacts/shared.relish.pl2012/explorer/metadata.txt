Web application for exploring and debugging the data objects within a running relish program.
Can be focussed on a particular object within the runtime memory or database of
another running relish program.
Then displays that object and its attributes, including other objects which 
are attributes of the focus object. Displays a portion of the object reference tree
(object network) out from the focus object.
Can be refocussed on any of the displayed objects.
Queries can be performed in the explorer's user interface 
to select objects for potential focus of the explorer.
This explorer runs as one program (process),
and the relish program being debugged is another program, 
which must be listening for http requests and must offer the explorer_api web service.
