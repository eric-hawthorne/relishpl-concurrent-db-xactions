""" 
 inheritance_and_multimethods.rel

 Test multiple inheritance of data types and their attributes and relations,
 as well as multimethod dispatch. (multi-argument polymorphic dynamic method-dispatch)
 where the method to be executed is selected based on the run-time type of all of the 
 required positional arguments.

 The following data type specialization lattice will be created as test data
 for these tests:

 Shape                  distance overlaps distance contains
   |    \     \     \
