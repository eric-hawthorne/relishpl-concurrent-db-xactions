Web service API for exploring data. Callers (clients) of these web services use an object name to obtain
a reflectId token for an object, then use the reflectId to request various attributes of the
object. Object attribute metadata and values are passed to the client in JSON format.
To create a data explorer (data object-network navigator) debugging tool for looking at both
persistent and non-persistent data in a relish program, the data explorer program can be a client
of this API. The explorer runs as one program (process), and the relish program being debugged is
another program, which must be listening for http requests and must offer the explorer_api web service.
