This interface provides access to the package whose method is currently executing,

database queries in a multi-threaded context.

threads in Go which may be cooperative coroutines or may be mapped onto separate processor threads and/or cores.
Typically, multiple goroutines will execute in a single OS thread, but if multiple cores are available and
Go is configured to use them, then groups of goroutines may be apportioned across multiple OS-threads and cores.
