IMPORTANT

If you add a package which has some Go native methods implemented in go packages under the
relish/runtime/native_methods/standard_lib directory or the  
relish/runtime/native_methods/extensions directory,
you must include a wrapper-creating function with the set of go methods, 
such as the files.InitFilesMethods method, and you must create an entry
in the map below recording the association of the full package path (the package identifier)
with the corresponding wrapper-creating function.
