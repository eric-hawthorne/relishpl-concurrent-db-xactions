IMPORTANT

If you add a type whose instances are native-Go-implemented, you must add the fully qualified type name to 
this map, so that the RType object will configure itself as having .IsNative = true
This will cause a GoWrapper object to be instantiated upon a constructor call for the type. 
You must then implement a native Go constructor function in a .go file in 
the approprate native_methods/extensions package, to actually construct and initialize the Go object instance.
