# Contributors to the relish free and open source (FOSS) project:
#
# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the relish repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, employees of a company or organization are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because the company or organization holds the copyright.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure
# that people submitting code are listed in this file (by email address).
#
# Names should be added to this file only after verifying that
# the individual or the individual's organization has agreed to
# the appropriate Contributor License Agreement, found here:
#
#     http://relish.pl/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html
#     http://relish.pl/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html
#
# The agreement for individuals can be filled out on the web.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file,
# either J's name or J's organization's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS file, depending on whether the
# individual or corporate CLA was used.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Name <email address>
#
# An entry with two email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the second address should be recognized as the
# same person.

# Please keep the list sorted.
