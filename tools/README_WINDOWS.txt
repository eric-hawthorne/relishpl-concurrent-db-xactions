Relish.tmLanguage is a syntax highlighter configuration file for relish programming language 
source code files (.rel files)

This configuration file works in Sublime Text 2 (or 3) to enable
relish source code syntax colouring in this code editor tool.

------------------------------
To install in Sublime Text 2 (or 3), place the file as follows:

%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2/Packages/Relish/Relish.tmLanguage

You may have to restart Sublime Text 2 (or 3) but recent experience is that you don't.

Then, in Sublime Text 2 (or 3)
1. Open a .rel file

It may then just work, colouring the program text. If not, ...

2. Go to the View menu
      Syntax 
        Open all with current extension as...

        Relish

3. Shield your eyes from the dazzling colours.
