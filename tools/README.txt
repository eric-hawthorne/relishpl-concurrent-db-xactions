Relish.tmLanguage (and its companion file, Relish.tmLanguage.ForBundleEditor) is a 
syntax highlighter configuration file for relish programming language source code files (.rel files)

This configuration file works in Sublime Text 2 (or 3) and TextMate (a text editor for Macs) to enable
relish source code syntax colouring in these editors.

------------------------------
To install in Sublime Text 2 (or 3), place the file as follows

Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/Relish/Relish.tmLanguage
OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Relish/Relish.tmLanguage
Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2/Packages/Relish/Relish.tmLanguage

You may have to restart Sublime Text 2 (or 3) but recent experience is that you don't.

Then, in Sublime Text 2 (or 3)
1. Open a .rel file

It may then just work, colouring the program text. If not, ...

2. Go to the View menu
      Syntax 
        Open all with current extension as...

        Relish

3. Shield your eyes from the dazzling colours.

----------------------------
To install in TextMate, you should be able to install it like this:
Option 1: 
---------
a. In TextMate, open the file Relish.tmLanguage.ForBundleEditor
b. Select all of the contents of the file and press command-C or Edit/Copy
c. Select Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Edit Languages  from TextMate menu 
        
d. from the + dropdown at bottom left of screen, choose "New Language"
Name the language "Relish"
