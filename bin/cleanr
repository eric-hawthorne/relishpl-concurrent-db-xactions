# NOTE: Must be run from within a relish installation directory tree or
# a relish project directory tree. i.e. At .../relish or below.
#
# Removes all pkg directories in the local (unshared) artifacts directories,
# thus forcing all local artifacts and packages to be recompiled from relish source code
# next time they are needed, instead of just loading .rlc intermediate-code files. 
# Cleans all versions of all local artifacts.
#
# You can also clean only a single local artifact by issuing a command like
# 
# cleanr shared.relish.pl2012/relish_tests
# 
# which will clean all local (unshared) versions of the artifact.
#
# cleanr shared.relish.pl2012/relish_tests 1.0.23
#
# Cleans only local (unshared) version 1.0.23 of the specified artifact.

# See also the rmdb script.
