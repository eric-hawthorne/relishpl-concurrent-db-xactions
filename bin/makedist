# Creates a new release of the relish binary distribution, by copying appropriate files
# out of your local copy of the source distribution.
#
# First, when you are on a given platform, e.g. a Mac, 
# compile the relish compiler-interpreter program by using
# go install relish/relish    (assumes your GOPATH env var is set to your relish source distribution directory e.g. to ~/devel/relish)
# Now you have a relish executable for Mac as ~/devel/relish/bin/relish
# Now 
# makedist 1.0.2 darwin_amd64   to produce the binary distribution directory tree ~/devel/relish_dist/relish_1.0.2.darwin_amd64
#
# which produces
# ~/devel/relish_dist/relish_1.0.2.darwin_amd64.tar.gz
#
# but also leaves around the un-tarred distribution directory.
#
# Other platforms to make binary releases on are linux_386 and linux_amd64
